The DART spaceship has to travel across space in order to reach the
Chicxulub Impactor, the asteriod thought to have eradicated the dinosaurs.
However, we can assume an optimal collision angle because DART's launch
can be controlled, and we can assume perfect momentum transfer because
we're working in space. Therefore, rather than model the travel of the
DART spaceship, we're pre-emptively calculating the momentum transfer
and modifying the initial momentum of the impactor for each simulation.
